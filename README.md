vim-linux
=========

This is a repo for plugins and setup for linux distributions that I have control over what version of vim and other tools like python, tmux, ruby, scala and haskell.  In a hosted environment I don't have control to keep those tools up to date or utilize specific features or plugins.

I could have probably done separate branches for different environments.  I'll pull that together at another date.
